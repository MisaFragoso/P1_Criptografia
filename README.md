# P1_Criptografia
First Project “Secure Communication Protocol Implementation” Cryptography 2024-2
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary libraries to run a Flask application with cryptographic functionality. Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, while PyCryptodome and Cryptography are libraries that provide cryptographic functionalities. By following these instructions, you'll be able to set up your development environment and start building secure web applications using Flask and cryptographic techniques.

Features
Secure end-to-end messaging using symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
Digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages.
Password-based key derivation for generating cryptographic keys.
Secure storage of private keys using passphrase-protected RSA key files.
User-friendly web interface for easy interaction and messaging.

Flask:
To install Flask, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
'pip install flask'
This command will download and install Flask and its dependencies.

PyCryptodome:
Similarly, you can install PyCryptodome using pip. Type the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install pycryptodome
This will download and install PyCryptodome, which is a collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented in Python.

Cryptography:
To install the Cryptography library, use pip as well. Enter the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install cryptography
This command will download and install the Cryptography library, which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives.

After executing these commands, Flask, PyCryptodome, and Cryptography will be installed on your system, and you'll be ready to run your project. Remember to execute these commands in your terminal or command prompt.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Enter a username and secret passphrase to log in and start chatting securely.
Upload your RSA private key file or generate a new key pair.
Exchange messages with other users securely, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
